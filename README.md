UrbanSound Classification
This project focuses on sound classification using the UrbanSound8K dataset, which contains 8,732 labeled sound excerpts from urban environments. The dataset is classified into 10 distinct categories, ranging from air conditioners to street music. The goal is to classify these sounds based on their audio features using deep learning techniques, achieving high classification accuracy.

Dataset
The UrbanSound8K dataset consists of audio clips that are 4 seconds long. Each sound clip is labeled with one of 10 urban sound categories. These categories are:

Air Conditioner
Car Horn
Children Playing
Dog Barking
Drilling
Engine Idling
Gunshot
Jackhammer
Siren
Street Music
The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets, with each audio file coming with a metadata file containing information like the fold number, class label, and the unique ID of the audio clip.

Methodology
Feature Extraction
Before applying machine learning models, we extracted features from the raw audio files using methods such as Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) and spectrograms, which are common in audio classification tasks. These features capture essential characteristics of sound that are critical for classification, such as frequency content and temporal patterns.

Model Architecture
We employed two types of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architectures for sound classification: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU). These architectures are particularly well-suited for sequential data, such as time-series data in audio.

LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory):
LSTMs are a type of RNN designed to capture long-term dependencies and patterns in sequential data. We used LSTM layers to capture the temporal patterns in the audio features, allowing the model to learn from the sequential nature of the sound data.
GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit):
GRUs are a variation of RNNs that are simpler and computationally more efficient than LSTMs, but still effective at capturing long-term dependencies. They were used as a comparative model to LSTMs, as they often perform similarly while being faster to train.
Training Process
The models were trained on the training set using a categorical cross-entropy loss function, which is suitable for multi-class classification tasks.
We used Adam optimizer for its efficiency in handling sparse gradients and its ability to adapt learning rates during training.
During training, we monitored the model's performance on the validation set to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting.
Performance
After training, the LSTM and GRU models were evaluated on the test set, where the LSTM model achieved an impressive accuracy of 94%.
The results demonstrate the modelâ€™s ability to effectively classify urban sounds, even in the presence of noise or similar-sounding categories.
Challenges
One of the main challenges faced during the project was dealing with background noise in the audio files. The models were trained to recognize sounds in noisy environments, which is a typical characteristic of urban soundscapes.
Class imbalance: Some classes in the dataset, like "car horn," were more frequent than others, which may have caused the model to be biased toward those classes. This issue was addressed by employing data augmentation techniques and ensuring balanced mini-batches during training.
Future Improvements
While the model achieved high accuracy, there is still room for improvement. Future steps include:

Hyperparameter tuning: Further optimization of the models by tuning learning rates, batch sizes, and the number of layers in the LSTM and GRU networks.
Ensemble methods: Combining the predictions of multiple models (e.g., a mix of LSTM, GRU, and Convolutional Neural Networks) to improve classification accuracy.
Data augmentation: Further augmentation of the dataset by introducing noise, varying the pitch, and using time-stretching to make the model more robust.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of LSTM and GRU models for classifying urban sounds from the UrbanSound8K dataset. Achieving 94% accuracy highlights the potential of deep learning in real-world audio classification tasks. The ability to classify urban sounds can be useful in various applications, including smart cities, environmental monitoring, and assistive technologies for the hearing impaired.
